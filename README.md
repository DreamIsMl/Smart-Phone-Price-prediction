Smartphone Price Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the price of smartphones. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features of smartphones, such as processor speed, RAM, storage capacity, camera quality, etc.

Model Building
I have employed several machine learning algorithms to build and compare the performance of the model. These include:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
I have provided the code and model files for each algorithm in separate directories within this repository.

Usage

To use the model, you have two options:

Direct Model Use:

You can load the trained model using the provided Python scripts in each algorithm's directory.
Example usage can be found in the respective README.md files.
Web Application (Streamlit):

I have created a web app using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for the model.
To run the web app, follow the instructions in the web_app/README.md file.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is available in the data/ directory. It contains information about various smartphones along with their corresponding prices.

Dependencies
List the libraries and packages that are required to run your code. For example:
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Getting Started
Provide instructions on how to get started with using the model and/or running the web application. This could include steps like:

Cloning the repository
Installing dependencies
Running the code/app
